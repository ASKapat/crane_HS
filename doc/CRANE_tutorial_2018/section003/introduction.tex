		\item CRANE may be used for any general system of ODEs
		\item The following examples focus on solving reaction networks both within plasma discharges and in more general cases:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Predator-Prey} - basics of running CRANE
			\item \textbf{Collisional-Radiative Model} - stiff and nonstiff ODEs
			\item \textbf{Two reaction example} - physical units, reading rate coefficient from Bolsig+ data
			\item \textbf{Argon chemistry} - equation-based rate coefficients; auxiliary variables; reading tabulated data; adaptive timestepping
			\item \textbf{Nitrogen chemistry} - reading time-dependent data; including auxiliary species in reaction equations
		\end{enumerate}
